# Documentation 

This project uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the core documentation you are reading, and [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/pawamoy/mkdocstrings) to generate the source reference documentation from docstrings. 

## Generation and Deployment
We use github actions to generate the static html and github pages to publish and host them.
See the [workflow](../.github/workflows/main.yml) for how deployment works.
